Using SQLAlchemy perform the following queries on your database:

1. Query all of the puppies and return the results in ascending alphabetical order

for puppy in session.query(Puppy).order_by(Puppy.name):
    print puppy

2. Query all of the puppies that are less than 6 months old organized by the youngest first

from datetime import datetime, timedelta
sixmonthsago = datetime.now() - timedelta(weeks=26)
for puppy in session.query(Puppy).filter(Puppy.dateOfBirth > sixmonthsago).order_by(Puppy.dateOfBirth):
	print puppy, puppy.dateOfBirth

3. Query all puppies by ascending weight

session.query(Puppy).order_by(Puppy.weight).all()

4. Query all puppies grouped by the shelter in which they are staying

Quesiton not clear. If they want us to count Puppies, grouping by shelter, then:

from sqlalchemy import func
session.query(func.count(Puppy.id), Shelter.name).join(Shelter, Shelter.id == Puppy.shelter_id).group_by(Puppy.shelter_id).all()

If they just mean order the Puppies by shelter, then:

session.query(Puppy).order_by(Puppy.shelter_id).all()
